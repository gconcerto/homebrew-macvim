# Homebrew Tap for MacVim [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/macvim-dev/homebrew-macvim.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/macvim-dev/homebrew-macvim)

## Note: Deprecation

This repo is currently deprecated. Homebrew Core maintains its own formula for MacVim (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/macvim.rb) and it is actively maintained and up to date. Consider using it in favor of this one.

## Usage

### One-time setup

 1. Install Homebrew

   - http://brew.sh/

 2. Tap MacVim formula

   `$ brew tap gconcerto/homebrew-macvim

### Install

    $ brew install --HEAD macvim-gconcerto
